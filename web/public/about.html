    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>This is This Side of Polling, a vanity project of Merlin Heidemanns. I came to election forecasting by accident
        with my advisor at the time asking me whether I wanted to participate in helping The Economist build their
        forecast for the U.S. Presidential election in 2020. One thing led to another and by way of an unimaginative
        spirit
        and desire to finish I continued working on forecasting for my dissertation project.<br>
        This project here was borne out of my continued interest in the area. Polling and election forecasting interest

        because it has a practical relationship to politics circumscribing peoples' vote intentions (rather than say
        stockmarket valuations),
        you can be wrong given an observed election outcome but also future polls, and lastly because there are so many
        factors floating
        around that make the task non-trivial. And I enjoy coding in <a href="https://mc-stan.org" target="_blank"
